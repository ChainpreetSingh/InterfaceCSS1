            <p>     The club isn't the best place to find a lover
                So the bar is where I go
                Me and my friends at the table doing shots
                Drinking fast and then we talk slow
                Come over and start up a conversation with just me
                And trust me I'll give it a chance now
                Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
                And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
                Girl, you know I want your love
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                Come on now, follow my lead
                I may be crazy, don't mind me
                Say, boy, let's not talk too much
                Grab on my waist and put that body on me
                Come on now, follow my lead
                Come, come on now, follow my lead
                I'm in love with the<span> shape of you</span>   <!--span is used to highlight a particular text..-->
                We push and pull like a magnet do
                Although my heart is falling too
                I'm in love with your body
                And last night you were in my room
                And now my bedsheets smell like you
                Every day discovering something brand new
                I'm in love with your body
                (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
                I'm in love with your body
                (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
                I'm in love with your body
                (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)

            <p>One week in we let the story begin
                We're going out on our first date
                You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
                Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
                We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
                And how your family is doing okay
                And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
                Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
                Girl, you know I want your love
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                Come on now, follow my lead
